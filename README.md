# Portal 2 with Fall Damage (P2:CE Addon)
 
Content source for the "Portal 2 with Fall Damage" Portal 2: Community Edition workshop addon.

NOTE: This addon has a custom panorama health display. When on the main menu after enabling this addon, run the command "panorama_reload". This will reload panorama and enable the custom health display. If the game complains about any errors, just press ignore.

Have you ever wondered what Portal 2 would be like if Chell didn't have her Long Fall Bootsâ„¢?
Well, wonder no more! :D

In this addon, fall damage is enabled and health regeneration is disabled. On the load of every map, Chell regains her health (unless health persistence is enabled).

-----

This mod has some settings you can adjust:

`SetMaxPlayerHealth(val)` // Sets the player's maximum health and heals the player to full health. Set value persists across maps. Takes an integer > 0 as a parameter.

`DoHealthRegeneration(val)` // Enables/Disables player health regeneration. Set value persists across maps. Takes a boolean value ('true'/'false') as a parameter.

`DoHealthPersistence(val)` // Enables/Disables player health persistence (whether the player's health in one level is transfered into future levels). Takes a boolean value ('true'/'false') as a parameter.

In order to change these settings, open the console whilst inside a map and run the command: script [function]
(e.g. `script SetMaxPlayerHealth(150)`).
